###I built 2 models with 2 different architectures for a car model classification problem.
###There are 196 car models in the data
###The data is "cars196" of tensorflow.
###the first, an end-to-end network CNN model,
###And the second is a model that uses a transfer-learning architecture, enjoy (:
